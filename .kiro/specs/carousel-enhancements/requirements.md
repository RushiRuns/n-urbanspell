# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing "Client Success Stories" carousel component to provide better user experience across different devices and fix current functionality issues. The enhancement focuses on adding responsive mobile controls, improving image display consistency, and implementing true infinite looping behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to have manual navigation controls for the carousel, so that I can browse through client success stories at my own pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on a mobile screen device (screen width < 768px) THEN the system SHALL display navigation controls (previous/next buttons)
2. WHEN the user is on a desktop screen device (screen width >= 768px) THEN the system SHALL hide the navigation controls
3. WHEN the user taps the previous button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous slide
4. WHEN the user taps the next button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next slide
5. WHEN the user interacts with manual controls THEN the system SHALL temporarily pause auto-advance functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing client success stories, I want all images to display correctly regardless of their aspect ratio, so that I can see the content clearly without distortion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image has a different aspect ratio THEN the system SHALL maintain the image's original proportions
2. WHEN displaying images of varying sizes THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent container sizing
3. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate scaling to fit the designated space
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL prevent stretching or squashing of content
5. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder or fallback image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing client success stories, I want the carousel to loop continuously in both directions, so that I can navigate seamlessly through all content without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the carousel reaches the last slide and advances THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the first slide
2. WHEN the carousel is on the first slide and goes backward THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the last slide
3. WHEN the carousel loops THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animation without jarring jumps
4. WHEN auto-advance is enabled THEN the system SHALL continue looping indefinitely
5. WHEN manual navigation occurs at loop boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide seamless transitions
6. WHEN the carousel initializes THEN the system SHALL prepare duplicate slides for seamless looping
